# Font Directory Notice

The fonts in this directory were originally included as part of the OpenSaaS.sh template. They were included in the initial project setup and have been retained without modification.

## Origin
- All fonts in this directory are from the original OpenSaaS.sh template
- No custom fonts have been added to this directory

## Usage Consideration
If you're actively developing this project, you may want to:
1. Review which fonts are actually needed for your application
2. Remove unused font files to reduce bundle size
3. Consider replacing with web fonts (like Google Fonts) if appropriate
4. Ensure proper licensing is in place for any fonts you decide to keep

## Note
